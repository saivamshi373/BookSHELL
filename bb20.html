Summary of the Book:<br>“It takes something more than intelligence to be able to write intelligently. . . Whatever it is, Sigrid Nunez has it. When I open one of her novels, I almost always know immediately: This is where I want to be . . . [What Are You Going Through is] as good as The Friend, if not better.” —The New York Times
 
“Emotionally intense and impossible to put down, this intimate novel about a woman asked to help a terminally ill friend end her life is leavened with wit and tenderness.”—People
 Its frank confrontation of bleak realities is exactly what energizes it. . .The result is a book as luminous as it is deep and as slippery as it is firmly grounded. As its narrator observes, “[N]o matter how sad, a beautifully told story lifts you up.” What Are You Going Through is as beautifully told as they come.”—Seattle Times </dd><br>
